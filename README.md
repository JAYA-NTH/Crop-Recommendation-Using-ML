🌾 Crop Recommendation System using ML
📌 Project Overview
This is a crop recommendation system designed to suggest the most suitable crops based on environmental and soil conditions. It helps farmers make informed planting decisions by analyzing these factors:

Nitrogen (N)
Phosphorus (P)
Potassium (K)
Temperature
Humidity
Rainfall
pH value

The recommendation engine is powered by a Random Forest Classifier trained on crop data, and is served through a Flask backend with an HTML/CSS frontend.
✨ Features
-Accepts key soil and climate parameters (N, P, K, temperature, humidity, rainfall, pH).
-Predicts the optimal crop using Random Forest Classifier.
-Flask backend integrates seamlessly with the ML model.
-HTML/CSS frontend provides a clean and user-friendly form interface.
-Instant result display after form submission.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Backend: Python, Flask
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Random Forest Classifier)
Frontend: HTML, CSS
Other Tools: Google Fonts, custom button styling for improved UI.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

💡 Usage
Enter the following values in the form:

Nitrogen
Phosphorus
Potassium
Temperature
Humidity
Rainfall
pH value

Submit the form.

Instantly view the recommended crop based on the trained model.
